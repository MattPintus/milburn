<h2>Sheffield favourites announce homecoming shows after eight year hiatus<h2>

It’s a chilly December evening in Sheffield. Two thousand music fans have made their way to the O2 Academy to see former Milburn frontman, Joe Carnall, play his annual Christmas show. Since he first announced the “Joe Carnall and Friends” idea in 2011, his gig has been the hottest ticket in town.

<p>
Cries of “Milburn, Milburn, Milburn!” fill the room as Carnall takes the stage.
There’s a frenzied anticipation in the air. Will they return? Won’t they return? It happens every year. A generation of twenty-somethings pleading with Carnall to let them re-live their teenage years just one more time. Usually, however, the false alarms are worth the heartbreak. Carnall is part of the Sheffield scene - he has friends in the business. This year, he welcomes Reverend and the Makers maverick, Jon McClure, to the stage.
<P>
As the encore looms, Carnall belts out his rendition of “Fairytale of New York” and a snow-like foam floats tranquilly into a pit of boozed-up fans. He leaves the stage to a chorus of Christmas cheer. Darkness.

<p/>
As the stage lights return, so does Carnall. But, this time he's joined by three friends: Louis Carnall, Tom Rowley and Joe Green. For the first time in eight years all four members of Milburn are on stage together. They begin playing “What you could’ve won”; the anthem they finished with back in 2008. The crowd goes wild.

<p>
Flash forward a month and, to mark the tenth anniversary of their album "Well, Well, Well", Milburn have announced four shows at the Sheffield O2 Academy. In just a matter of days, they've sold over 9,000 tickets.
<p>

<p/>
For Carnall, it's all been a bit of a roller-coaster: "I kind of knew the tickets would sell out, that was my gut feeling. But, the speed of things has been absolutely ridiculous. By the time I'd got to the O2 academy on the day of release, they'd all sold out."
<p>
Originally, the band planned to do two special anniversary shows. However, within three minutes of release, the tickets were all gone. Two further dates then sold out in equal measure.
<p>
"It's knocked us all back. The initial plan was to get in, do a couple of gigs and enjoy it for what it was. It's become a lot different to what we thought it'd be.
<p>
"It's great though, it gives the gigs a real buzz. Even before you walk on stage, you know it's going to be good."

 Joe, Louis, Tom and Joe officially formed Milburn in 2001. Within a year, the band were headlining venues all over the city:

"We had Sheffield going but we were still doing half and half at that point; half covers, half our own tunes. It took a few years of growing up before we were able to write some decent ones," said Carnall.
<p>
  It didn’t take long for the major record companies to notice Milburn’s potential and, in 2006, the band signed to Mercury Records.
<p>
"We did this brilliant gig in London, a tiny place; no more than a 150 person capacity. Our manager had managed to get a few labels down for it.
<p>
"Once a record company sees a good vibe happening, they start to twitch. They realise that, if they don't sign you up, someone else will," said Carnall.
<p/>
 The band produced two albums with Mercury -  Well, Well, Well (2006) and These Are The Facts (2007) - scoring the band a series of top 40 hits.
<p>
Despite the promising record sales and sell-out national tours, Milburn struggled to win over reviewers and journalists alike:
"It felt like the London centric media just weren't having it. We were derided as Arctic Monkeys imitators; a second rate Monkeys if you like.
<p>

<p>
  “I always felt like we were completely different. They had their hiphop influences. Whereas, we were more influenced by Ska music; we liked The Specials, two-tone stuff. Yet, journalists couldn't handle the idea of a multi-dimensional Sheffield scene. If it was Manchester, then great. But not Sheffield.
<p>
"We'd seen our contempories, our mates, take over the world. We felt a little left behind," said Carnall.

In a brief statement issued on March 28th 2008, Milburn announced their split.
<p>
  "I think if we'd been a bit older, we'd have said 'you know what lads, let's spend a year out'.
<p>
  "But we didn't, we were passionate and rash. Getting criticised a lot when you're nineteen is quite difficult to handle because you're not very mentally tough yet," said Carnall.
  <p>
The band went their separate ways, taking on normal day-to-day jobs: "I'm a part-time teacher and a married man now.
<p>
"It's tough because, although we'd like to commit fully to the band, we know that it might all collapse. Despite the façade, we've all got bills to pay."
</p>
However, they havent fully ruled out a future beyond the anniversary shows: "Who can say? We've all got our different lives. One thing I will say is that it's been a real laugh. I don't want to promise anything but we're all having a lot of fun at the moment. Who knows?"

    Meet Sheffield’s new kids on the block, The SSS. They were Exposed Magazine’s 2015 “Unsigned Band” of the year, they’ve played the prestigious Isle of Wight festival and, on the March 19th, they’ll headline a sell-out at the Leadmill for the first time.
    <p>
<p>
    For lead guitarist, Morgan Somers, it's been a dream: "We wouldn't have believed it if you’d told us we’d be headlining the Leadmill after three years.
<p/>
    “Playing such an iconic venue makes us feel like we’ve taken our first step to being accepted. We’ve worked up the venues and different capacities selling out gigs, now seemed the right time to take it on."

<p>
<h3> Milburn's Legacy?</h3>
<p/>
    “We all grew up around Sheffield's boom of indie bands, with Milburn at the forefront," said Somers.
<p>
    “But, if you’re a carbon copy, don’t expect to get anywhere.
<p>
    “It’s about using the likes of Milburn and the Arctic Monkeys as an influence and managing to nurture a unique sound which people like.”
<P>
    In Somers' view, it’s about staying grounded: “I don’t think our demands are unreasonable. Millionaires, Vegas residency, pals with Leonardo DiCaprio; you know the score.”
